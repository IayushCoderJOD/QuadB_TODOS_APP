# React To-Do Application

This repository contains a simple To-Do application built with ReactJS, demonstrating the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React components, hooks, and Redux for state management.

## Application Features

- **Add Task:** Users can input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
- **View Tasks:** Displays all added tasks in a list format.
- **Delete Task:** Each task has a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
- **Edit Task:** Each task has an edit button that, when clicked, opens a popup to edit the task.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved to local storage so they are not lost on page reload.

## Bonus Features (Optional)

- **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed without deleting them.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the layout.
- **CSS** for styling the application (with optional use of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI).
